		<h1>About Me</h1>
		
		<!--I introduce myself.-->
		
		<h2>Who am I?</h2>
		<p>Hello! My name is Fatima Abdul Razzaq and as of June 23, 2021, I am 15 years old. My birthday is on the 17th of May. I am the youngest in a family of four,
		consisting of my parents, my older brother and I. My older brother is 22 years old, we have an age gap of 7 years and I love him very much. My parents are nice people,
		and I am very grateful for them. My ethnic background is Hyderabadi, Indian and I speak a language called Urdu(although apparently I'm not very good).</p>
		
		<!--I talk about personality types, Hogwarts house and my zodiac sign.-->
		
		<h2>My Personality</h2>
		<p> It's difficult for me to describe my personality. I would say that I am a fairly friendly person, and I am easy to get along with. I am quite talkative and love 
		interesting conversations. My zodiac sign is Taurus, which means I'm intelligent, dependable, hardworking, dedicated, and stubborn. However, I can confirm that the only
		two qualities I meet in that list would be dependable and stubborn. My Hogwarts house is Slytherin, which makes me really happy. I love the colours(Green and Silver) and traits
		of Slytherins. My patronus is the Nebelung Cat and my wand is pine wood with a unicorn hair core, 14 Â¼" and supple flexibility. 
		I have also taken a few personality tests, and I am enneagram type 3 and Myers-Briggs type ENFJ-T(The Protagonist).</p>

		<!--I talk a little about my hobbies and link the "Hobbies" page.-->
		
		<h2>Some of my Hobbies</h2>
		<p>I like to read and write a lot. I enjoy art. I like music of all types, my taste is very inclusive. I also really like having discussions and debates
		about pretty much anything. If you want to know more about a few of my hobbies, check out my <a href = " Hobbies.html">Hobbies Page</a>! I hope we have some things in common!</p>
