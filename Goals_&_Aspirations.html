		<!--I talk about my love of cheesemaking.-->
		
		<h2>Cheesemaking</h2>
		
		<p>My dream is to be a cheesemaker. You may be thinking, 'Why cheese?'. Well let me tell you, cheese is superior to everything else. If the the fact that it's literally cheese
		is not enough to explain my passion for cheese, there's more.</p>
		<li>There are over 1800 cheeses in the world, from across the globe.</li>
		<li>The way they're made, cut, served and eaten are all different. It is unique to each individual culture that has cheese.</li>
		<li>Almost every culture has cheese.</li>
		
		<!--I talk about some cheese history.-->
		<h3>The History of Cheese</h3>
		
		<p>Thousands of years ago, some random caveman forgot to do their job and they realized that leaving milk
		out in warm temperatures causes clumps to form. When they drained the liquid(whey), they figured out that these clumps(curds) were edible. Curds were then turned into cheese. Cheese had many nutrients and could be preserved 
		for a long time. When rennet was dicovered(an animal byproduct found in some mammal stomachs that controls the coagulation of milk) many more cheeses were born and they became famous. Cheese trade was very succesful.
		Cheese has been refined and perfected since, and it is still superior to everything else.</p>
		
		<p>Here's a short video on the history of cheese by everyone's favourite channel: Ted-Ed! It goes into a bit more detail and is a great introduction.</p>
		
		<!--I talk about some cool cheeses, add relevant images and link relevant videos.-->
		
		<h3>Some Cheeses I Think Are Cool</h3>
		
		
		<h4>Brie Cheese</h4>
		<img class = "cheese" src = "images/brie.jpg" width = "200" height = "213">
		<p class = "cheese_desc">I think Brie Cheese is really cool. It's a bloomy rind cheese, which means it has white fluffy mold as it's rind(which is completely edible!). I like how
		it's kind of sticky. When it's aged, it'll form this brown mottling on the outside which stands out against the white. It's also a very popular cheese that many people love.</p>
		
		<h4>Gorgonzola Cheese</h4>
		<img class = "cheese" src = "images/gorgonzola.jpg" width = "200" height = "124">
		<p class = "cheese_desc">I also think Gorgonzola is an awesome cheese. It's said to be the worlds most famous Italian Blue Cheese. I find blue cheese to be
		really cool in general. The blue vein is mold growing inside the cheese, and is said to have a tangy almost bitter taste. The way it's made can be seen 
		<a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPqK5LyGsiE">in this video</a>. Gorgonzola is also really fun to say.</p>
		
		<h4>Parmigiano Reggiano Cheese</h4>
		<img class = "cheese" src = "images/parmigiano_reggiano.jpg" width = "200" height = "136">
		<p class = "cheese_desc">Parmigiano Reggiano is also a very special cheese. It's a cooked pressed cheese that can only be made in certain regions of Italy(hence
		its name). It's a bit crumbly and is made exclusively from raw or unpasteurised cow's milk. You can see how it's made <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj2wrNnhMpc">in this video</a>.
		I think that it's very cool, also referred to as the King of Cheese.</p>
		
		<h4>Havarti Cheese</h4>
		<img class = "cheese" src = "images/havarti.jpg" width = "200" height = "200">
		<p class = "cheese_desc">Havarti is a Danish cheese meaning it's from Denmark. This cheese is semi-hard and very creamy. It melts well. Havarti is said to have a 
		very mild balanced taste that anyone can enjoy. It goes well with anything, as a salid dressing or just plain snacking cheese. I think that's very nice.</p>
		
		<h4>Mozzarella Cheese</h4>
		<img class = "cheese" src = "images/mozzarella.jpg" width = "200" height = "150">
		<p class = "cheese_desc">I am weak for mozzarella. It is said to have been invented by mistake when cheese curds fell into hot water. This is simply a happy accident
		and I think it's fantastic. Here you can see <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et7cMypDwqU">a video<a/> on how mozzarella is made. Mozzarella is most commonly
		used in incredible dishes such as pizza and mozzarella sticks. It is a comfort cheese and one of my personal favourites.</p>
		
		<h3>Serving Cheeses</h3>
		<p>Cheeses can be served with numerous snacks to make it more enjoyable. These are called pairings, and they really make the flavours of different cheeses stand out. There are many 
		pairing for many cheeses, and the idea is to experiment to see what you like best. Here's <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTgm36y884c">a video</a> to help you get familiar with what these are, and how to cut and serve a few formidable cheeses.</p>
