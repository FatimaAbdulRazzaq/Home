		<p>I changed schools. Starting from Senior Kindergarten, I attended Islamic Foundation School. This was a religious private school, 
		and I went there for 9 years! While I did not particularly enjoy my time there, it was a significant experience and a big part 
		of my upbringing. A lot happened during this time.</p>

		<p>The elementary school building was a mosque, also known as the Islamic Foundation of Toronto and had many services, the academic program being one of them.</p>

		<p>Next to the elementary school building was the middle and high school building. This was exclusively for the academic program. By the time I went, the highschool had shut down
		so the highest grade was the 8th grade, up until which I attended the school.</p>
